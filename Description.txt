***This mod is not stackable with any mod that changes the Lystrosaurus.***
Breeding an army of dinosaurs and need them to have a few levels? Get an improved Lystro! 
Improved XP Buff range, duration, and multiplier, all configurable by INI.
This is not tested for effect on stasis dinosaurs. My expectation is that it will not work on them.

Check the discussions for ini configuration options!

Thanks to Woeful Macabre for helping me with the graphing to remove the buff HUD from the players so that it wasn't in the way.
Thanks to Orionsun and Tao for helping me push through the dino replacement function.
